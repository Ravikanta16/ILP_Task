Topics Covered:
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- Generic Types
- any Type

Notes:

• Express.js:
  - Express is a web framework for Node.js.
  - Used to create APIs and handle routes (GET, POST, etc.).
  - `app.get()` is used to create a GET route.
  - `req` (request) and `res` (response) objects are used to handle data.

• TypeScript:
  - TypeScript is JavaScript with types.
  - It helps catch errors during development.
  - Use `interface` or `type` to define the shape of an object.

• Generic Types:
  - Generics make code flexible and reusable.
  - Example: `function identity<T>(arg: T): T { return arg; }`
  - You can use any type in place of `T` (like string, number, etc.).

• any Type:
  - `any` disables type checking.
  - Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.
  - Prefer specific or generic types for better code safety.
